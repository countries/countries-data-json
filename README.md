Countries data - JSON
=============

![Auto Update Country Data](https://github.com/countries/countries-data-json/workflows/Auto%20Update%20Country%20Data/badge.svg?event=schedule)

This repository represents a collection of all sorts of useful information for every country in the ISO 3166 standard. It contains info for the following standards ISO3166-1 (countries), ISO3166-2 (states/subdivisions), ISO4217 (currency) and E.164 (phone numbers).

It is based on data automatically extracted from the [`countries`](https://github.com/countries/countries) Ruby gem.

The project is intended to be used as a git submodule in other projects that rely on this data. It is designed so that it updates itself and follows the `countries/countries` repository for updates automatically.
